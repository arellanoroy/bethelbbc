							<p class="scroll-anim">When you walk through our doors, you can expect…</p>
							<ul class="list-content">
								<li class="scroll-anim">
									<p><strong><em>1 /  FRIENDLY PEOPLE</em></strong></p>
									<p>Our church is not a big congregation - we average around 45 people every Sunday. That means everyone knows each other and we’re really just like one big family. That means that the second you walk in Bethel, you’ll be greeted by an usher (and those who aren’t ushers!) who will make sure that you’re well taken care of and comfortable. </p>
									<p>Also, since our Pastor is Filipino, naturally, the church is attended by a lot of Filipinos. However, over the years we have had countless nationalities walk through the doors of Bethel. Everyone is welcome! </p>
								</li>
								<li class="scroll-anim">
									<p><strong><em>2 /  ZERO JUDGMENT</em></strong></p>
									<p>We mean it when we say that everyone is welcome at Bethel.</p>
									<p>Just because we go to church, it does not make us better than anyone else. Church is a place for people who are hurting, searching and looking for comfort. </p>
									<p>You will also find that most of us are dressed up in our “Sunday best” and give monetary donations. However, please don’t feel pressured to do so. Once again, there is zero judgment.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="scroll-anim">
									<p><strong><em>3 /  ASSISTANCE WITH CHILDREN</em></strong></p>
									<p>We are also aware that you may have kids with you - we have that covered as well.</p>
									<p>We have a nursery for children ages 0-6 run by volunteers who all have a Working with Children check completed. If you, as a mother, are not comfortable leaving your newborns, you are more than welcome to stay with your child at the nursery or at our foyer which has a video and audio feed of the service so you won’t miss out on anything. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="scroll-anim">
									<p><strong><em>4 /  CHRIST-FOCUSED WORSHIP</em></strong></p>
									<p>Our worship is conservative. That means you won't see drums, backup singers, dancers or more contemporary methods found in other churches. We believe that when we worship, all the attention, focus and glory should only be directed to God, for He alone is worthy of praise.</p>
									<p>We are very much traditional in worship as we have found this allows us to not only praise God, learn about who He is through song, but it also helps prepare our hearts and minds for the preaching of God's Word. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="scroll-anim">
									<p><strong><em>5 /  BIBLE PREACHING</em></strong></p>
									<p>At the core of Bethel is the preaching of God's Word. </p>
									<p>We preach from the King James Version and seek to faithfully teach what the Bible says, without adding anything extra. Our style of preaching is one that convicts, teaches, exhorts, edifies and encourages Christians to live for Christ and to strive for Christ-likeness.</p>
									<p>The Word of God is quick, powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword - it is able to change people's minds and hearts. This is why when we preach, we let the Bible speak for itself.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="scroll-anim">
									<p><strong><em>6 /  GOSPEL-FOCUSED CHURCH</em></strong></p>
									<p>Bethel is a Gospel-focused church. As a church, our responsibility is to lead people to Christ as well as to baptise and teach them. The fact is that we are all sinners, on our way to Hell and need a Saviour.</p>
									<p>This is where the Good News of the Gospel comes in. </p>
									<p>Christ came to earth over 2,000 years ago, lived a sinless life and died, while taking our sins upon Himself. This satisfied God's holiness and judgment of sin.</p>
									<p>Because of what Christ did on that day, we are now able to claim that as payment for our sins. </p>
									<p>Christ literally paid the penalty of our sins so that we won't have to! Now Christ is offering the gift of salvation freely to everyone who will repent of their sins and place their faith on Him solely. However, not only is the Gospel able to save, but it is also able to change people's lives. </p>
									<p>This is the Gospel and we as a church will take every opportunity to tell anyone who walks through our doors that: "Jesus saves!"</p>
